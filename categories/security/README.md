## Usage Guidance

### Getting Started

Security steering documents will help you:

- Implement secure coding practices from the start
- Prevent common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Follow authentication and authorization best practices
- Handle sensitive data securely

### Installation Example

```bash
# Copy a security steering document to your project
cp categories/security/input-validation.md .kiro/steering/
```

### Best Practices

- Apply security steering documents early in development
- Combine multiple security documents for comprehensive coverage
- Review generated code for security implications
- Keep security steering documents updated with latest threats

### Security Considerations

- Security steering documents provide guidance but don't replace security audits
- Always review security-critical code manually
- Use additional security tools for vulnerability scanning
- Follow your organization's security policies

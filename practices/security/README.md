## Usage Guidance

### Getting Started

Security steering documents will help you:

- Implement secure coding practices from the start

- Prevent common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

- Follow authentication and authorization best practices

- Handle sensitive data securely

### Installation Example

```bash
# Copy a security steering document to your project
cp categories/security/input-validation.md .kiro/steering/

```

### Best Practices

- Apply security steering documents early in development

- Combine multiple security documents for comprehensive coverage

- Review generated code for security implications

- Keep security steering documents updated with latest threats

### Security Considerations

- Security steering documents provide guidance but don't replace security audits

- Always review security-critical code manually

- Use additional security tools for vulnerability scanning

- Follow your organization's security policies

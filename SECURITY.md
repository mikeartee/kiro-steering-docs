2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

- **Initial Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 14 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
- We prefer coordinated disclosure after a fix is available
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using steering documents from this repository:

1. **Review Content**: Always review steering documents before using them
2. **Test First**: Test in a non-production environment
3. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest versions of documents
4. **Report Issues**: Report any security concerns you find

### For Contributors

When contributing steering documents:

1. **No Secrets**: Never include API keys, passwords, or secrets
2. **Safe Examples**: Use placeholder values in examples
3. **Validate Input**: Include input validation in examples
4. **Security Focus**: Consider security implications of patterns

## Known Security Considerations

### Steering Documents

- Steering documents guide code generation but don't execute code
- Always review generated code before committing
- Be cautious with documents from unknown sources
- Test documents in isolated environments first

### Repository Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions workflows are reviewed before merge
- Dependencies are monitored via Dependabot
- Markdown linting prevents some injection attacks
- No executable code in steering documents

## Security Updates

Security updates will be announced via:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Repository releases
- README updates (for critical issues)

## Scope

This security policy covers:

- The repository infrastructure
- Validation tools and scripts
- Documentation and templates
- Community processes

This policy does NOT cover:

- Third-party tools referenced in documents
- User implementations of steering documents
- External dependencies (report to their maintainers)

## Questions?

If you have questions about this security policy:

- Open a discussion (for general questions)
- Email maintainers (for sensitive matters)

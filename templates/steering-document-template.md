## Core Principle

[One sentence explaining what this steering document does and why it matters]

## How Kiro Will Write [Language/Framework]

### [Rule Category 1]

**[Specific Rule]**: [Clear description of the rule]

```[language]
// Kiro will write:
[good example]

// Not:
[bad example]

```

### [Rule Category 2]

**[Specific Rule]**: [Clear description of the rule]

```[language]
// Kiro will write:
[good example]

// Not:
[bad example]

```

### [Rule Category 3]

**[Specific Rule]**: [Clear description of the rule]

```[language]
// Kiro will write:
[good example]

// Not:
[bad example]

```

## What This Prevents

- [Specific problem 1 that this steering solves]

- [Specific problem 2 that this steering solves]

- [Specific problem 3 that this steering solves]

- [Specific problem 4 that this steering solves]

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Copy this file to `.kiro/steering/[filename].md` and Kiro will automatically apply these standards when writing [language/framework] code.

### Example Output

When you ask Kiro to create a [specific type of code], it will follow these standards:

```[language]
[Example of properly formatted code that follows all the rules]

```

## Customization

This is a starting point - you can modify any rules to match your team's preferences. The key sections to customize are:

- **[Rule Category 1]**: Adjust [specific customizable aspect]

- **[Rule Category 2]**: Modify [specific customizable aspect]

- **Tags**: Add project-specific tags for better organization

## Optional: Validation with External Tools

Want to validate that generated code follows these standards? Add these tools:

### Quick Setup (Optional)

```bash
[package manager command to install validation tools]

```

**Note**: These tools validate the code after Kiro writes it, but aren't required for the steering document to work.

### Configuration Example

Create `.[config-file]` in your project root:

```[config-format]
[example configuration that matches the steering rules]

```

## Installation

1. Copy this file to `.kiro/steering/[suggested-filename].md`

2. Kiro will automatically apply these standards

3. Test by asking Kiro to write some [language/framework] code

4. Optionally set up external validation tools (see above)

## Troubleshooting
